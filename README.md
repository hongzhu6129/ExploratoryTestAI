# ExploratoryTestAI
This repository is for the research on exploratory testing of AI applications conducted by the team led by Professor Hong Zhu at Oxford Brookes University, Oxford, UK. It is a part of the research project on datamorphic software testing methodology for testing AI applications.
1. Table of Contents
Morphy -- The folder contains the automated software testing tool Morphy
-- Morphy.bat   batch script file to start Morphy on Windows OS
-- Morphy.jar   executable jar file
-- MorphyAnnotations.jar  package jar file for building morphy test code
-- icons        the folder contains the icons used by the Morphy GUI

Experiments -- The folder contains files used for conducting the control experiments with the exploaratory testing of classifiers 
-- src    The Java source code of the classifiers and the test code
-- bin    The class files of the test code of the classifiers and the test code
-- TestScripts  The test scripts for executing the experiments
-- Experiment data  The data generated by executing the test scripts. They are the result data of the experiments

CaseStudy -- The folder contains all files of the case studies with the exploratory testing of machine learning applications
-- BankChurners   The folder contains all files of the case study on the bank churners prediction application
-- Mushroom       The folder contains all files of the case study on classification of mushrooms on their edibility
-- RedWineQuality The folder contains all files of the case study on classification of red wine according to their quality 

For each of these folders, it contains the following subdirectories: (where XXX is Bank, RedWine or Mushroom)
-- Builders   The original dataset and Python code to construct the models using various machine learning algorithms.
---- XXX_Build_Models.py    The Python code to build various ML models
---- XXX.csv    The original dataset in csv format used as the input to build models
---- XXXV2.csv  The original dataset with the headline removed for used in morphy test code as input 
---- XXXTrainingData The dataset in the Morphy's internal representation. It contains only the input data, i.e. the labelled output is excluded. 

-- models   The folder contains the models produced by the Python code
---- Model Info.txt   The output of the Python code about the accuracy of the modles
---- XXX Model Info.xdoc    The information of the models' accuracy in MS Word format, etc. 
---- YYY_model.sav    The model generated by the Python code, where YYY is the name of the model. 

-- PyScript   The folder contains Python script that are invoked by the test scripts to execute the predictions on input data. Each invokes on model. 

-- src    The source code of the test system in Morphy 

-- TestScript The test scripts for conduct various experiments in the case study using Morpthy.
