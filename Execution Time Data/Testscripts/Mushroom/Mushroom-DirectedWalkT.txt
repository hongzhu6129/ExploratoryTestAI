//Pre-condition: 	The model is started. 
//Post-condition: 	(1) The results are save to the ExpDataFile.csv file. 
// 		(2) The model remains running. 
//Function:  Execute the directed walk exploration strategy on all directions with 1000 runs for 10 times. 
//	The execution time together with other data are recorded.
